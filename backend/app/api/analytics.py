"""Private engagement dashboard — admin only (#249).

Everything here is owner-visible intelligence about who engaged with the
portfolio, so every route sits behind ``get_current_admin_user`` at the ROUTER
level: an analytics endpoint that answered unauthenticated would leak recruiter
activity to the internet.

The feature flag is enforced by a second router-level dependency: with
``ENGAGEMENT_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false`` these routes 404, so the dashboard has
no route to reach — the same "off means gone" contract the recording side
keeps by never writing a row.
