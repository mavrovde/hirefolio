# check_compose_env.sh — the documented-knob contract (v1.13.0 retrospective).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS — three blocker-level review findings in ONE release, same class:
#   * #296 blocker 3 — `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml config` gave the
#     backend 35 environment keys, "none matching SMTP/MAIL": the prod `mail`
#     profile started a relay the app could never talk to.
#   * #297 blocker 3 — `setup.sh` and `README.md` told the owner to set
#     BEACONFOLIO_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN / _CHAT_ID / BEACONFOLIO_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL;
#     measured: "TELEGRAM present: []  NOTIFY present: []  env_file: None".
#     A "2-minute setup" that could not work.
#   * #298 blocker 4 — TRANSLATION_ENABLED / OWNER_LANGUAGE documented at
#     .env.example:190-195; `docker exec … env | grep -c` → 0. The acceptance
#     criterion "the flag disables the feature cleanly" was undeliverable.
# and two priors the repo already wrote comments about: ADMIN_PASSWORD (#256)
# and LINKEDIN_IMPORT_TOKEN (see docker-compose.yml's own inline notes).
#
# ROOT CAUSE, once: neither compose file uses `env_file:`; each service carries an
# explicit `environment:` ALLOWLIST. A key absent from that list never reaches the
# container no matter what the root `.env` says — and `app/config.py`'s own
# `env_file=".env"` resolves INSIDE the container, so it does not save you.
#
# THE CONTRACT this enforces:
#   a key that (a) is a real `backend/app/config.py` Settings field AND (b) is
#   named in a file that PROMISES the owner the knob exists — `.env.example`,
#   `README.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` or `setup.sh` — MUST appear in the backend
#   service's `environment:` block of BOTH `docker-compose.yml` and
#   `docker-compose.prod.yml`.
# Keys nobody documents, and documented keys that Settings does not bind (proxy,
# db, image tags), are outside the contract and are never reported. Measured
# against the three round-1 heads of this release: the doc sources beyond
# `.env.example` are what make it catch #297 (the Telegram/webhook trio was
# promised by README + setup.sh before it was ever added to `.env.example`).
#
# Exemptions: add the key to EXEMPT_LIST below WITH A REASON. An exemption without a
# reason is how a guard's scope rots (lessons §21/§32).
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/check_compose_env.sh            # exit 1 on any gap
#         bash scripts/check_compose_env.sh --list     # derived contract + exemptions

LINKEDIN_COOKIES_DIR:the path is the TARGET of the linkedin_cookies: named-volume mount in both compose files; forwarding it alone would let an owner point the app at an UNMOUNTED path and silently stop persisting the session. Found by this check on the v1.13.0 tag and resolved in .env.example instead
EMBEDDING_MODEL:documented only inside README.md's explicitly-labelled BARE-METAL backend/.env block, which is not a compose surface
GEMINI_API_KEY:pre-#141 legacy name, documented only as IGNORED; the compose files pass the legacy NAMES (never values) via LEGACY_GEMINI_ENV so the backend can warn about them
GEMINI_ENCRYPTION_KEY:same — pre-#141 legacy name, documented only as ignored
