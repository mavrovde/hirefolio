# Self-test for scripts/check_migration_heads.sh.
#
# The house rule (lessons §18, §16): a gate that has never been observed to fail
# is indistinguishable from a gate that cannot fail. So every case here asserts a
# DIRECTION, the negative cases outnumber the positive ones, and the last case
# replays the real #323/#325 fork out of this repository's own history.
#
# CASE COUNT DIFFERS BY ENVIRONMENT, and that is deliberate: **26 locally, 23 in
# CI**. `actions/checkout` clones at depth 1, so the three real-history cases
# cannot resolve `aef2938`/`2cf326f` and skip with a printed `~ skipped:` line
# rather than failing. The contract they illustrate is fully covered by the
# synthetic `--against` fixtures, so buying them back with `fetch-depth: 0` would
# cost a full clone on every run for no additional coverage. Stated here because a
# self-test that quietly reports a different number in CI is exactly the kind of
# unexplained gap this suite exists to catch. The MIN_CASES floor at the bottom
# makes that note enforceable rather than descriptive (#329 review, nit 8).
