# Guardrail against irreversible LOCAL/infra destruction (issue #116).
#
# A PreToolUse `Bash` hook: it inspects the command JSON on stdin and BLOCKS
# (permissionDecision: "deny") a small, high-blast-radius set of destructive
# commands that would wipe stateful local resources the user never explicitly
# authorized destroying — Docker volumes, whole non-`test_*` databases, or data
# directories. Defense-in-depth BEYOND the generic permission classifier, which
# only blocked the #91 incident (`docker volume rm mavrovde_open-webui_data`) by
# luck.
#
# COMMAND-POSITION AWARE: it matches only when a destructive command is actually
# being *invoked* — not when the same text merely appears as an argument (a
# `git commit -m "...docker volume rm..."` message, a `grep`/`echo` of the
# pattern, docs). It splits the command on shell separators and inspects the
# FIRST token of each segment; segments whose command is a text/VCS tool
# (git/grep/echo/cat/sed/awk/…) are skipped. It also transparently unwraps common
# indirection — `sudo`/`env`/`nohup`/`time`, `xargs [opts]`, and `bash -c` /
# `sh -c` / `eval "…"` — so `… | xargs docker volume rm` (the "remove ALL volumes"
# idiom) and `bash -c "docker volume rm x"` are still caught. It never interferes
# with normal work (build, test, `verify_all.sh`, `manage.sh`, `test_*` teardown).
#
# A backup is NOT consent: to run one of these deliberately, either export
# GUARD_DESTRUCTIVE=0 for an authorized session, or prefix that ONE command's
# segment with the bypass token, e.g.  GUARD_DESTRUCTIVE=0 docker volume rm <name>
# (the bypass is honored only as a LEADING env-assignment of the segment being
# guarded — a stray `GUARD_DESTRUCTIVE=0` elsewhere in the line does not disarm it).
set -uo pipefail
# Segments are iterated via unquoted command substitution (word-splitting on
# newlines is exactly what we want there). Without `-f`, a segment containing a
# glob character would additionally be rewritten by whatever files happen to sit
# in the working directory — so what the guard inspects could differ from what
# was typed. Disable pathname expansion for the whole script.
set -f

# Byte-wise scanning (#219). Under a UTF-8 locale, bash's ${s:i:1} indexing is
# O(n) per access (it re-counts multibyte characters from the start), which made
# the character loops below quadratic — a 24 KB command cost ~8 s against a 15 s
# hook timeout, and a hook that times out does NOT deny. Every character this
# guard dispatches on (quotes, backslash, separators, `<<`, `#`, `$`) is ASCII,
# and UTF-8 continuation bytes always have the high bit set, so they can never
# alias any of them: scanning bytes is semantically identical and ~3.5x faster
