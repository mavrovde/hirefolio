# Merge gate (v1.12.0 retrospective): rule 13 and the Closes/AC contract,
# enforced mechanically instead of asked for in prose.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS — measured over v1.12.0's review verdicts:
#   * Rule 13 (independent APPROVE before merge) is restated across eleven
#     files with zero mechanical enforcement anywhere.
#   * `Closes #NN` against an issue with unticked acceptance criteria was a
#     BLOCKER in four PRs (#254, #257, #258, #284). Every one was caught only
#     because a review read the issue by hand. A `Closes` decides the issue's
#     fate automatically at merge, so an unmet criterion closes silently.
#
# Merging is the sanctioned prod-deploy trigger (rule 8) — the irreversible
# moment this repo already guards elsewhere. Within its boundary this hook
# FAILS CLOSED: anything it cannot analyse or verify is a deny, never an allow.
#
# THE BOUNDARY, stated honestly (#291 review rounds 5-7): this is a
# COMMAND-TEXT gate. It analyses the Bash tool's command string and nothing
# else, so a merge that arrives as FILE CONTENTS or through an opaque transport
# is invisible to it — measured open shapes: `cat script.sh | bash`,
# `bash script.sh`, and `ssh -o "ProxyCommand=..."`. Guarding file execution
# is the destruction guard's territory and a different analysis; pretending
# this hook covers it would be the same false comfort the heredoc comment gave
# (round 2). A further NAMED residual inside the command-text boundary: a
# quote-split command WORD — `gh pr me"rge" N` — reassembles only in the shell,
# and this gate does not model word-level concatenation (measured ALLOW; the
# accepted guard-destructive.sh carries the same residual, #291 round 8). The
# honest promise is therefore: no merge typed as a PLAINLY-SPELLED command
# slips through; an author quoting mid-word is evading, not typing.
#

# HEADING POSITION, not "anywhere in the body" (v1.13.0 retrospective). Measured
# on #291: two of that thread's marker-bearing comments are the AUTHOR's
# fix-reports ("## Round 4 — the three blockers, each measured against the
# unfixed hook", "## Round 7 — blocker and all four majors closed"), and the
# FIRST marker inside each is APPROVED / APPROVE. Under the old filter either one
# was "the newest verdict" the moment it was posted, so a merge attempted then
# would have been ALLOWED while the standing reviewer verdict was REQUEST
# CHANGES. In this repo the reviewer and the author post under the SAME identity,
# so no author-based filter can separate them — the position of the marker can.
#
# A verdict therefore states itself in its FIRST NON-EMPTY LINE. Decoration
# around it is fine (`## ⛔ REQUEST CHANGES`, `✅ **APPROVED** — round 2`,
# `## VERDICT: APPROVE (round 2)` all qualify); a marker buried in paragraph
# three does not. This is fail-CLOSED in both directions: a reviewer who forgets
# the heading gets "no posted review verdict" (deny), never a false allow.
# `.claude/agents/pr-reviewer.md` mandates the heading form.
#
# It closes a SECOND false-allow too, found by this change's own reviewer: #293's
# `## ⛔ REJECTED` body has no marker in its heading and exactly one anywhere —
# the prose "expect to approve immediately" (line 108) — which the old
# case-insensitive body-wide match read as the verdict and allowed on.
#
# KNOWN RESIDUAL, deliberately unpinned (lessons §43): a fix report whose FIRST
# LINE itself carries a marker is still selected and still allows.
#
# THIS SHAPE IS POSTED IN THIS REPO — measured, not hypothetical. Sweeping all
# 145 merged PRs (179 marker-bearing headings across 92 of them) finds two author
# fix reports that the selection above picks OVER the reviewer's verdict:
#   #281 (2026-09-06) "Round-1 APPROVE findings applied on `1abb0fe` …", 6 min
#        after the reviewer's `## ✅ APPROVED`;
#   #181 (2026-08-30) "Approved-with-findings applied before merge:", 2 min
#        after the reviewer's `**✅ APPROVED** — …`.
# Both were DECISION-NEUTRAL — the standing verdict was itself APPROVE — so no
# false-allow has occurred. Flip the standing verdict and the same sentence
# allows a merge against REQUEST CHANGES: the #291 hole, one line up.
#
# It stays unpinned anyway, because no lexical rule separates it from a REAL
# reviewer heading that also puts prose BEFORE the marker — all measured in this
# repo: `## Round 3 — ✅ APPROVED` and `## Round 2 — ⛔ REJECTED (…)` (#255), and
# `PR-REVIEWER VERDICT: APPROVE` (#171). The first is already pinned as a case in
# pre-merge-gate.test.sh. Tightening buys the residual at the price of rejecting
# those. The GUARD is therefore the charter convention (`pr-reviewer.md` +
# `agents/PLAYBOOK.md`: a fix report opens "## Round N — what changed", never with
# a marker), and a case asserting the residual could never fail, so it is
# documented rather than tested (the #240 answer, applied again).
#
# REVISIT TRIGGER — deliberately NOT "an actual bad merge": the shape exists, so
# waiting for the incident is the posture this repo argues against. Revisit on the
# first fix report with a leading marker posted while the standing verdict is
# NEGATIVE — that instance is decision-CHANGING, and it is the cheap signal.

# --- Check 1b: the approval must COVER the head (v1.14.0 retrospective) ------
# Rule 13 asks for a verdict on the CHANGE, not for a verdict at some point in
# the PR's history. Check 1 above only asked "is the newest verdict an APPROVE",
# which is satisfied by an approval of a head that no longer exists.
#
# MEASURED IN v1.14.0 — FOUR of the ten REVIEWED merges (an 11-PR corpus; #321
# merged with no verdict at all) carried commits no approval had seen, and one of
# them was not close:
#   #320  approved 06:57:04Z on b91f908; then 0537a86 (five review findings),
#         54158e8 (merge of main), e6373a4 ("banner links to the repository, not
#         the maintainer's site" — a behaviour change) and 8290bca landed, and it
#         merged 07:43:35Z with no second verdict. The reviewer never saw the
#         fixes to their OWN findings.
#   #315  approved 13:40:54Z; the six-finding fix commit 2a7c1a0 landed 13:45:03Z;
#         merged 14:03:18Z — TWO SECONDS before the delta-confirm was posted.
#   #314  approved 14:00:11Z; be1ffc2 (merge of main + a lesson renumber) landed
#         14:12:38Z; merged 14:17:58Z.
#   #327  the RELEASE PR: approved 12:09:07Z; 882ddae landed 12:10:52Z; merged
#         12:25:17Z — so the v1.14.0 tag sits on a commit no verdict covers.
# "Merge of main" is not a benign case: #325's Alembic head fork was created by
# exactly that, and cost a production-boot blocker one review round later.
#
# The remedy is cheap and the repo already has the habit — #315's reviewer posted
# "## ✅ APPROVE — round 2 (delta-confirm at 2a7c1a0)". This check makes the habit
# the rule.
#
# KNOWN LIMIT, stated rather than implied: `committedDate` is set when the commit
# is CREATED, not when it is pushed, so a commit authored before the verdict and
# pushed after it is invisible here — and a badly skewed committer clock could
# hide one. GitHub exposes no push time on `gh pr view`, and no reviewer-side
# commit oid at all for the COMMENT verdicts this repo's same-identity constraint
# forces. This closes the shape that actually happened three times; it is not a
# proof of coverage.
