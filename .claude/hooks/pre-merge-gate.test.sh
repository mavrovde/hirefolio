# --- Mutation contract -------------------------------------------------------
# `--mutations` proves the cases above actually bite. The FIRST version of this
# section was itself fake-green: mutants were written to a temp dir WITHOUT
# `hook-parse-lib.sh`, so every mutant died on a missing library — a
# byte-identical copy "died" too, and the honest score was 4 of 10. The harness
# now defends against that specific failure:
#   * the shared lib is copied beside the mutant, so a mutant fails for its OWN
#     reason;
#   * an IDENTITY mutation must SURVIVE — if it dies, the harness is broken and
#     every other result is meaningless, so the run aborts;
#   * a mutation that produces NO diff, or that leaves the script unparseable
#     (`bash -n`), is an invalid experiment and fails the contract rather than
#     counting as a kill.
