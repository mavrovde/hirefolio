/**
 * Rewrites relative API/asset URLs to absolute, container-internal addresses
 * during SSR — but only at the point the request is actually dispatched to the
 * network, i.e. inside the `HttpBackend`, **not** in an `HttpInterceptorFn`.
 *
 * ## Why the rewrite must live here (issue #25 — blog "flash to home")
 *
 * Interceptors registered via `withInterceptors()` run *before* Angular's HTTP
 * transfer-cache interceptor (a root-level interceptor appended after all
 * feature interceptors in the chain). When the rewrite lived in an interceptor
 * (the removed `ssr.interceptor.ts`):
 *  - during SSR, the transfer cache computed its key from the *rewritten*
 *    absolute URL (`http://backend:8000/api/app/posts/x`);
 *  - during hydration, the browser computed its key from the *original*
 *    relative URL (`/api/app/posts/x`).
 *
 * The keys never matched, so the browser never found the SSR-cached response
 * and re-fetched every request on hydration. A transient failure of that
 * needless blog-post re-fetch then hit `BlogPostComponent`'s `catchError`,
 * which navigates back to `/` — the "flash to home" of issue #25.
 *
 * Rewriting here, in the `HttpBackend`, happens *after* the transfer-cache
 * interceptor has already read/written its entry keyed on the original URL
 * (identical on server and client), so the client reuses the SSR response.
 *
 * ## Why we delegate to `HttpXhrBackend`, not `FetchBackend` (issue #94)
 *
 * The first attempt at this fix (PR #84) delegated to `FetchBackend`, which
 * forced the *browser* off Angular's XHR backend and deterministically broke
 * the public site's only genuine browser fetch (`GET /api/app/stats/public`
 * → `net::ERR_FAILED`), failing `footer-stats.spec.ts` and blocking the
 * deploy. This backend instead delegates to `HttpXhrBackend` — the exact
 * backend the app has always used on both platforms (browser: `BrowserXhr`;
 * server: platform-server's xhr2 factory) — so the browser dispatch is
 * byte-identical to the working baseline. Only the *server-side* URL rewrite
 * changes location (interceptor → backend); nothing about the browser path
 * changes, so #94 cannot regress.
