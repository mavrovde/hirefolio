/**
 * UNMOCKED contract test for POST /ai/multi-chat (issue #187).
 *
 * `multi-agent.spec.ts` — the spec named after this endpoint — `page.route`-mocks
 * it, so nothing in the suite exercised the real thing. That is how #180 hid:
 * crewai 1.x rejected the LangChain client and the endpoint raised *before* the
 * generator's first yield, which (the body having already started) surfaces as
 * **HTTP 200 with a truncated body**, not a 500. `response.ok` was true, every
 * guard passed, and 778 unit tests stayed green while the public /llm page showed
 * "Connection Error".
 *
 * `max_turns: 1` keeps this to a single generation (~5 s) instead of the default
 * twenty sequential ones (~85 s locally, and multiples of that on a CPU-only
 * runner) — the failure mode being guarded against is structural, so one turn
 * proves it exactly as well as twenty.
 *
 * Rule 10: the E2E stack runs with an empty HIREFOLIO_GEMINI_API_KEY, so generation falls
 * back to the in-stack Ollama. No paid API is reachable.
